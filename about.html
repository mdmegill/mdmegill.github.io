        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>Humans of Science is a website inspired by the reknown photoblog known as Humans of New York.  The goal 
          of this website is to showcase scientists and their accomplishments, as well as to communicate science and 
          conservation practices to the public in a way that is easy to understand.  
          </p>

          <p>The Humans of Science logo above depicts what in physics is known as a light cone shown below.
          <img src="images/light cone.png">
          </p>
          <p>Symbolically the "H" from humans is in the future light cone while the "S" is in the past light cone.
            This represents how we as humans drive the future advancement of science by drawing conclusions from 
            science done in the past. 
          </p>

            Taken from chemistry, the dots around around the letters represent an accurate electron dot diagrahm of what hydrogen
            bonded to oxygen bonded to sulfur would look like...if this chemical actually existed.  I just
            thought it would be cool to include an electron dot diagraham in the logo.
